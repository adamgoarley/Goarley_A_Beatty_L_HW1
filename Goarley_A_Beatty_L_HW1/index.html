			Hello, My name is Lucas Beatty aka the One Handed Bandit, I'm 24 and have been in school for animation at Algonquin and now attending Fanshaw for Interactive Media Design. I'm a wanna be animator and graphic designer it's been a dream of mine since I was a kid I've always had the dreams of making worlds that people could get lost in.
